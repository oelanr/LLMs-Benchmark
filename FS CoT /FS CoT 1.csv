"A factory produces 1,000 units per day. Each unit costs $30 in raw materials and $10 in labor. If the factory operates for 20 days in a month, what is the total production cost for the month?",huggingface:meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,1.9184401035308838,"To find the total production cost for the month, we need to multiply the daily production cost by the number of days the factory operates.

Daily production cost: 1,000 units/day × $30/unit = $30,000

Since the factory operates for 20 days in a month, we multiply the daily production cost by 20:
$30,000 × 20 days = $600,000

Alternatively, you can also break down the cost as follows:

First, calculate the daily cost: 

Cost of raw materials per unit = $30
Cost of labor per unit = $10
Total cost per unit = $30 + $10 = $40 per unit

Daily cost = 1,000 units/day × $40 per unit
Daily cost = $40,000 per day

Now, calculate the total."
