"A software development company needs to hire 10 developers for a project. Each developer costs $50 per hour, and the project is estimated to require 800 hours of development time. The company also needs to budget for overhead costs of $10,000 and an additional $5,000 for software tools. What is the total estimated cost of the project?",huggingface:meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,2.277853012084961,"To find the total estimated cost of the project, we need to calculate the costs for the developers, overhead costs, and software tools.

**Developer Hire Cost:**

There are 10 developers needed, with an hourly rate of $50.
Cost of hiring 10 developers = number of developers * hourly rate
= 10 * $50
= $500

**Overhead Costs:**

The overhead costs are given as $10,000.

**Additional Costs (Software Tools):**

1.
Cost of developer labor: 
- Number of developers needed: 10
- Cost per hour per developer: $50
- Total hours required: 800
- Calculate total labor cost: Total labor cost = (number of developers * cost per hour) * (total hours required)
- Total labor cost = (10 * $50) * 800
- Total labor cost."
